## Welcome to the English Corner.

Power of Self Talk
　　Life is like a big swing, dangling between the depths of happiness and sadness. As soon as we descend down the slope of sadness, we accelerate over the ever-feel-good acclivity of happiness. At times of distress, when we are down we slip over an abyss of emotional trauma and frustrations. One who can rise above the occasion, is the architect of many wins over sorrows.

　　To come above tougher times you have to pep yourself up, when you are feeling low, lost and confused. This can be done effectively by self-talk. Self-talk is a way of talking to oneself. It can be effectively used for soul searching. When talking to ourselves, we hardly lie as our conscience controls our speech. Self talk is efficient because when we are vocal about our thoughts, it makes a larger impact on our mind.

　　Our brain then receives the same message from the mind as well as the ears. This repetition pep talks and thoughts fine tunes the performance of brain.

　　Self-talk is a software, which when properly loaded onto our mind directs ourselves for better results and a healthy mind. Actually many times in our life, we find others advising us to do better in studies, sports, life etc. We usually get bugged by these people and blank our ears out of their constructive suggestions. It is because it doesn't come from within us. And when something comes from within you, you always try your best to do justice to it. Self-talk can thus ameliorate our status.Each one of us has some good points and some bad ones.

　　Though we hardly admit in pubic, we know in our mind that we could do better in some areas of our personal landscape. This get better attitude can be converted into a practical reality using self-talk.

　　If you are an introvert and you want to be the gregarious person like you friend next door, all you need to do is talk to yourself. Tell yourself with all the sincerity and emotions that "I can be like him. I am a natural born speaker. I do like people and speaking comes naturally to me. I just have to be ready to listen and speak". Suppose you love a person and want to tell him or her, then just say to yourselves "I love her with all my heart. She is the only one and I know it. If I don't let her know, it would be grave injustice on my part.

　　Every person loves to be loved. Even she will". These are just some examples I have explained. It's up to you to program your own mantra. If you are highly optimistic to do better, there is no better motivator than self-talk. So guys start talking.

自言自语的力量
生活像一具大秋千，总在开心和忧愁间摇摆。每当我们陷入忧愁的低谷时，我们以开始冲向开心的谷顶。在深陷悲痛，跌入感情创伤和绝望的深渊的时候，能够从中走出来的，就是战胜悲伤的赢家。

　　当你感觉情绪低落，失落和迷惘时，要从艰难中走出，你要不断激励自己。这可以用自我交谈的方式有效地实现。自我交谈其实就是与自己对话，它能够有效地运用于灵魂的探索。当我们和自己谈话时，我们很难说谎，因为我们的良心支配着交谈。自我交谈之所以有效，是因为我们可以听到自己的想法，这对我们思想有很强的影响力。我们的大脑像耳朵一样从思想中接受信息。重复激励的谈话和想法会调节大脑的反应。自我交谈是一个软件，当它被恰如其分地转载我们的思想时，它就能指引我们得到好的结果和一个健康的心态。实际上我闪在生活中常发觉别人劝告自己要在学习、体育和生活等方面做得更好。我们经常对别人在我们耳边的唠叨感到厌烦，对富有建设性的建议也听不进去。这是因为这不是来自我们内心的声音。当这个声音来自你的内心时，你就会全力以赴去实现它。因此，与自己对话可以改善我们的现状。每个人都有优点和弱点。虽然我们不会在公共场合承认，我们清楚自己在个人生活的某些方面可以做得更好。通过自我交谈我们可以做得更好，这个观点就能在生活中变为现实。

　　如果你是内向型的，你想如你隔壁的朋友那样出众，你所要做的就是和自己交谈。充满诚挚和感情地告诉自己“我可以像他一样，我是个天生的演说家。我确实喜欢人们，和人交谈很自然。我只要准备好倾听和谈话就是了。” 假设你爱一个人，你想告诉他或她，那么就对自己说“我全心全意地爱她，我知道她是我的唯一。如果我不告诉她，这对自己很不公平。每个人都喜欢他人所爱的。她也一样。” 这些只是我用来解释的例子，怎么说取决于你自己。
