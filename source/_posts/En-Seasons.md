### Welcome to the English Corner.
There are four seasons in the year. Theyre spring, summer, autumn and winter.

Spring is warm and sunny. In spring days, everything in our nature is green, so we can go out to release ourselves and breathe the fresh air. I think its a good way to enjoy our beautiful nature.

Summer is hot and rainy, but summer is the best season for entertainment, because we can go swimming in the sea and enjoy the beautiful sunshine on the beach. It must be very interesting.

Autumn is very cool and comfortable, and it is also the best season for harvest. In autumn days, the farmers are busy in their fields. If we had a chance, we could go to the countryside and pick up some fresh fruits and vegetables.

Winter is very cold and freezing. In winter, our world is covered with white snow, so we can either make snowmen or fight with snow. And we can also enjoy the beautiful ice lanterns in Harbin. But I prefer to go to Sanya during that time. As its on Hainan Island, the weather is always so temperate. Even in December, I can still enjoy the green palm trees, the beautiful sea, the sunny beach and the blue sky. Maybe I can find endless pleasure there.


### 翻译

一年有四个季节.它们是春天，夏天，秋天和冬天。

春天是温暖又阳光灿烂的。在春天，自然界中的一切都是绿色的，所以我们可以释放自己，呼吸新鲜空气。我认为这是享受美丽的大自然的一种很好的方式。

夏季炎热多雨，但夏季是休闲娱乐的最佳季节，因为我们可以在海里游泳，在沙滩上享受美丽的阳光。那肯定很有趣。

秋天很凉爽舒适，也是收获的最好季节。秋天的时候，农民们在他们的田野里忙碌。如果我们有机会，我们可以去乡下摘一些新鲜的水果和蔬菜。

冬天很冷，很冰。冬天，我们整个世界都被雪覆盖了，所以我们可以堆雪人或者打雪仗。我们还可以欣赏哈尔滨的美丽的冰灯。但我更喜欢在那段时间去三亚。因为它是在海南岛，天气总是很温和。即使是在十二月，我仍然可以享受绿色的棕榈树，美丽的大海，阳光明媚的沙滩和蔚蓝的天空。也许我可以在那里找到无穷的乐趣。
